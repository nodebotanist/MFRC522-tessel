# Tessel 2 RIFD reader/writer-- MFRC522 

Just trying to see if I can get something working here-- I want to use Amiibo and related stuff in future demos.

Reference Material:

* Data Sheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MFRC522.pdf
* Raspberry Pi Lib (have NOT tested this myself): https://github.com/firsttris/mfrc522-rpi

Todo:
